# Awesome Disentangled Representations

A curated list of papers on disentangled representation learning inspired by https://github.com/sootlasten/disentangled-representation-papers and https://github.com/matthewvowels1/Awesome-VAEs.

Since the original curated list([sootlasten/disentangled-representation-papers](https://github.com/sootlasten/disentangled-representation-papers)) seems to be stopped now, and I would like to add some summarization using GitHub issues, I decided not to fork the repository but make a new curated list.

To respect the original repository, I've added a tag(`[copied]`) in front of the name of the paper which was originally listed in [sootlasten/disentangled-representation-papers](https://github.com/sootlasten/disentangled-representation-papers). I also use the star and `?` notation to show the importance of the paper following the original repository. The judges of the original repository are remained, but `?` may be replaced by my judge.
